# Kirket

Kirket is a cricket scoring website and a cricket analysis tool that aims to ease the scoring of cricket games and give players and coaches tools to analyze and visualize their game statistics. This project was completed in the summer of 2020 in a team of 2. Kirket is currently still in development and my main responsibilities were the frontend portion of this single page web app.
